  "problem": "Define a function which routes requests through servers. The routing should be decided by the round-robin algorithm.",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the set of servers or resources to balance.",
    "Implement a load balancer that distributes requests using a round-robin or other balancing algorithm.",
    "Monitor server health and remove unhealthy servers from the pool.",
    "Ensure requests are routed efficiently and fairly.",
    "Test the load balancer under various load and failure scenarios."
