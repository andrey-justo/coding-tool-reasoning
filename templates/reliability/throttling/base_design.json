  "name": "Throttling Design Pattern",
  "problem": "Define a function to preserve usage of resources based on client requests. Preserving the usage should be based on the timing bucket and maximum requests allowed; if resources are overloaded then slow requests until it cannot receive any other requests.",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the resource or service to throttle.",
    "Implement a throttling mechanism using timing buckets and request limits.",
    "Monitor request rates and slow down requests when limits are approached.",
    "Block or queue requests when the system is overloaded.",
    "Test throttling under normal and peak load conditions."
  ]
