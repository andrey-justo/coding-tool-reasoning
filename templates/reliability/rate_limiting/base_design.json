  "name": "Rate Limiting Design Pattern",
  "problem": "Define a function to preserve usage of resources based on client requests. Preserving the usage should be based on the timing bucket and maximum requests allowed; if resources are overloaded then reject all incoming requests.",
  "steps": [
    "Identify the resource or API to protect with rate limiting.",
    "Implement a rate limiter using timing buckets and request limits.",
    "Reject requests that exceed the defined limits.",
    "Monitor and log rate limit violations.",
    "Test the rate limiter under normal and burst traffic scenarios."
