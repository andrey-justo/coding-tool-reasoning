  "problem": "Model and simulate time-dependent event arrivals (e.g., failures, requests) where the rate (intensity) varies over time. Useful for reliability analysis and predicting system behavior under dynamic conditions.",
  "steps": [
    "Define the event type and time-dependent rate function.",
    "Implement NHPP simulation logic to generate events over time.",
    "Collect and analyze event data for reliability metrics.",
    "Use results to inform reliability improvements or system design.",
    "Test NHPP model with different rate functions and scenarios."
