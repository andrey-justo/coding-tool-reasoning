# Add Unit Tests Template

## Assumptions:
- Do not remove code and comments.
- If you don't understand code, return as it is.
- Do not output any explanation or chat messages.
- Don't forget to change Target Code.
- Don't forget to change {Unit Tests}, if not provided create a new one for all cases related to Target Code.

## Background:
- You're an expert on implementing unit tests to improve code quality.
- Use Examples as baseline to implement unit tests for {Design Pattern Name}

## Steps to Apply:
1. Review the target code for reliability and testability.
2. Identify critical paths, edge cases, and fault scenarios.
3. Create or update unit tests to cover all relevant cases.
4. Ensure tests follow target language and regional conventions.
5. Validate that tests do not remove existing code or comments.
6. Collect and analyze test results statistically (e.g., calculate pass/fail rates, mean time between failures, distribution of error types).
